        <h3>Configuration</h3>
	<img src="/images/1.png" alt="Configuration">
	<p><strong>In the configuration screen we have to add the parameters that gives us the application of Latch when creating it.</strong></p>
	<p>The parameters Application ID and Secret Key are generated automatically by the Latch Application.</p>
	<p>The reload time parameter is the time it takes for the system to re-check all wireless devices connected. The minimum time is 15 seconds although 20 seconds is recommended.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="pair" class="none texto">
        <h3>Pair</h3>
        <img src="/images/2.png" alt="Pairing">
	<p><strong>In the pairing screen we can add a device (mobile phone, tablet...) to control the system and block/unblock access to the network for the wireless devices that are trying to connect </strong></p>
	<p>The Username parameter is used to recognise the control device. You can put any alias you want.</p>
	<p>The Pair code parameter is generated by the control device to pair with the plugin and start to control this system.</p>
	<h3>Unpair</h3>
	<img src="/images/3.png" alt="Unpairing">
	<p><strong>In the unpairing screen you can unpair the control device to add other</strong></p>
	<p>You only need to use the button with the alias name to unpair it</p>
   </div>
    <div id="devices" class="none texto">
        <h3>Devices</h3>
        <img src="/images/4.png" alt="Devices">
	<p><strong>In the devices list you can add a Permanent Mac and manage the connected devices</strong></p>
	<p>You can add a Permanent Mac using a alias to recognise it and the mac of the device. If you add a mac as permanent you wont manage it with the control device and will connect automatically without problems, but this is less secure than control all connected devices with the control device</p>
	<p>You have a list of devices connected to see some interesant info and the posibility to edit the devices</p>
	<h3>Editing Devices</h3>
	<img src="/images/5.png" alt="Editing Devices">
	<p><strong>In the Device editing screen you can put a alias to the device to recognise it and you can establish it as permanent mac</strong></p>
	<p>The alias parameter is only a name than you will use to recognise the device. For instance: "My Tablet"</p>
        <p>You have the posibility of add the device as permanent. If you put the mac as permanent this will disapear from your control device and will connect automaticaly and without control. Remember that this is less secure than control all devices with the control device</p>
        <p>if you want to delete a permanent mac you only need to unmark this option in the device editing screen and the system will delete it and start to control manually</p>
